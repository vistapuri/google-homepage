This first project was supposed to be an easy one, but it really challenged me.
Most of the code was trial and error, and i looked at the google source code a few times, mostly to see the color though.

What did I learn?
1. there are multiple ways available to get the same result.
2. The rules dont always make sense, sometimes when youre applying the same rule to different situation, it wont work. (maybe its because i have limited understanding)
3.No shame to go over what you've already learned all over again.

Improvements to focus:
1. I should plan my work better, maybe commit to Git more often.
2. More practice so i can work faster.
3. css:
   positioning
   usage of class n id
   practice using different kinds of properties.
   Which tags can be css "hooks".
4. HTML:
   sectioning
   common syntax.
   practice practice practice.
